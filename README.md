# Design-of-Surveillance-Aircraft
This is my Undergraduate last semester project
## project Abstract Discription:
In this thesis, by performing various simulations in Ansys workbench, it can be concluded that the Titanium alloy wings show better dynamic structural response as compared to wings made up of Aluminum alloys.
The results of simulations conclude that the Rectangular shaped wings give the most minor displacement when subjected to pressure.
Then I designed an Aircraft model using the wings on which I did the Ansys simulation, a complete aircraft model was designed using Fusion 360.
By keeping this model in mind, we ordered a kit that provided the raw materials for building an aircraft that resembled the aircraft we designed.
The working model of the flight had good stability and could fly for more than an hour on a single charge. 
This could be used for surveillance by attaching a camera to the bottom side of the fuselage.
